# fast-app
 
Fast App has two purposes.
1. To tell me, based on my intermitant fasting schedule, if I am fasting. Further, it reminds me whether it is a day on which I can eat something sweet,and whether it is my day to excercise. It also let's me know if I am drinking coffee that day.
2. To practice Typescript.

This app is not otherwise useful. All of its values have been hard coded, so it has no settings. I should also mention that I wrapped it in a WebView using Xcode which compiled an IOS app. Pretty damn nifty.
